## Description
gpt-welcomer is a WordPress plugin that limits content visibility for AI visitors like chatGPT or Bing AI bot, only a portion of the content is displayed in response. With this, you can express your intention that you do not want automatic information collection by AI and want a visit by a human.
We had a Lightning Talk about the concept of this plugin at the Tokyo MeetUp commemorating the 20th anniversary of WordPress, and received generally positive impressions that this is an interesting challenge.

## Installation
This plugin can be installed just like any other WordPress plugin.
you can install it from the plugin section of the admin panel by selecting 'Add New' and searching for "gpt-welcomer".

## Usage
From the settings page, you can select the percentage of the text to be displayed to each AI bot, and the message to be shown to the bot.

## FAQ
### Q1. Why do I need this plugin?
A1. Advanced AI technologies, like ChatGPT, are capable of browsing websites on behalf of humans, generating responses based on the contents of the pages. This eliminates the need for humans to browse the websites themselves. However, when humans stop browsing these sites, the number of page views decreases, potentially leading to the following disadvantages. This plugin aims to alleviate such situations.

(1) Hindrance in community development
(2) Loss of opportunities for engagement with potential customers
(3) Decrease in the revenue generated by advertisements posted on the site
(4) Difficulty in achieving goals when human page views are used as KPIs
(5) Inability to analyze user behavior patterns and popular content
(6) Unexpected security risks due to tasks that AI can perform but humans can't
(7) Increased server load due to an excessive number of accesses by proliferating AI bots
(8) Loss of uniqueness of site content if it gets learned by AI
(9) Perception of the site as one that does not prioritize humans
(10) Decrease in the brand value of the site if it is perceived as a site that doesn't need to be visited by people themselves.

### Q2. Why not use robots.txt?
A2. A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs on your site they can visit.but,
・Some crawlers ignore robots.txt
・If you set robots.txt, it will completely reject it, so no one will know that useful information exists in your site. At present, there are cases where crawlers for AI learning and conventional search are not completely separated.

### Q3. Can it deter all AI?
A3. Some AIs camouflage their UserAgent to pretend to be humans, so it's not possible to deter all of them. Among plugins developed for ChatGPT by third parties, some pretend to be human.
However, if we make a request to OpenAI, they may improve the situation.
For example, "Please make it a rule when developing a plugin to include a unique identifier such as 'ChatGPT-USER-Plugin' in the UserAgent string in order to identify it as an AI rather than a human."

### Q4. Are AI bots other than chatGPT not targeted?
A4. We do plan to extend the scope to include other AI bots in addition to chatGPT.

### Q5. What was the motivation for developing this plug-in?
A5. Our vision is to foster a future where both humans and AI can thrive together harmoniously.

Present copyright laws have yet to adapt to the advancements in AI, and there are no legal impediments to AI learning from the content of a website.

However, websites are fundamentally designed for human interaction. If the majority of people start leveraging AI to extract necessary information without directly accessing these websites, it could potentially lead to their downfall. This would be an issue not only for website owners but also for AI users.

We believe that the first step in addressing this issue is to allow people involved in various websites to voice their concerns.

This plugin is a tool for raising concerns.

### Q5. Isn't this plugin akin to the Luddite movement during the Industrial Revolution?
A5. It's understandable that one might draw parallels between this plugin and the Luddite movement, but our intentions are far from aiming to halt or reverse AI progress. Instead, we're inspired by the principles behind laws such as the Factory Acts during the Industrial Revolution, which sought to protect those in vulnerable positions from suffering unduly due to rapid industrial progress.

Our goal with this plugin is to create a dialogue about how we can adapt to the AI-driven future without causing undue harm to those who depend on the current structure of the web - particularly Internet industry people who rely on human traffic for their livelihood.

We see our plugin not as a rejection of AI, but as a tool to promote balance and ensure that the benefits of AI progress are equitably distributed. It may seem like a small step in the face of the vast changes AI brings, but we hope it will serve as a starting point for important discussions about our shared digital future.
