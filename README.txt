## FAQ
### Q1. Why do I need this plugin?
A1. Advanced AIs, such as ChatGPT, are capable of browsing websites and utilizing their content to generate responses.This potential ability could lead to a decrease in human page views, as AI may replace human interaction with the websites.This plugin aims to mitigate such possibilities.

### Q2. Can it deter all AI?
A2. Some AIs camouflage their UserAgent to pretend to be humans, so it's not possible to deter all of them. Among plugins developed for ChatGPT by third parties, some pretend to be human.
However, if we make a request to OpenAI, they may improve the situation.
For example, "Please include a unique identifier such as "ChatGPT-USER-Plugin" in the UserAgent string to identify it as a plugin".

### Q3. Are AI bots other than chatGPT not targeted?
A3. We do plan to extend the scope to include other AI bots in addition to chatGPT.

### Q4. What was the motivation for developing this plug-in?
A4. Our vision is to foster a future where both humans and AI can thrive together harmoniously.

Present copyright laws have yet to adapt to the advancements in AI, and there are no legal impediments to AI learning from the content of a website.

However, websites are fundamentally designed for human interaction. If the majority of people start leveraging AI to extract necessary information without directly accessing these websites, it could potentially lead to their downfall. This would be an issue not only for website owners but also for AI users.

We believe the initial step towards addressing this issue is to empower website owners to voice their concerns.

### Q5. Isn't this plugin akin to the Luddite movement during the Industrial Revolution?
A5. It's understandable that one might draw parallels between this plugin and the Luddite movement, but our intentions are far from aiming to halt or reverse AI progress. Instead, we're inspired by the principles behind laws such as the Factory Acts during the Industrial Revolution, which sought to protect those in vulnerable positions from suffering unduly due to rapid industrial progress.

Our goal with this plugin is to create a dialogue about how we can adapt to the AI-driven future without causing undue harm to those who depend on the current structure of the web - particularly Internet industry people who rely on human traffic for their livelihood.

We see our plugin not as a rejection of AI, but as a tool to promote balance and ensure that the benefits of AI progress are equitably distributed. It may seem like a small step in the face of the vast changes AI brings, but we hope it will serve as a starting point for important discussions about our shared digital future.
